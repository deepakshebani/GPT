This repository contains a simple demo e-commerce site for men's wear. The site lives in the `menswear` directory and is built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The styling loosely mirrors the layout used on popular sports apparel stores and includes a product grid and a minimal shopping cart.

## How to Use

Open `menswear/index.html` in a web browser. The JavaScript dynamically renders a selection of sample products. Use the "Add to Cart" buttons to populate the cart and see the total cost update.
